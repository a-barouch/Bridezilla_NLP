There is ample space to socialize or hang out, including a huge TV in front of comfortable couches, a room with hammocks, a pool table on the second floor, and a rooftop lounge area with canvas covering.

Cliff, the owner, greeted us personally, as he likes to do, and showed us around. The place has a water purifier (important in Bocas due to the water being poisonous if it\\'s not purified), a pool table (which is really in a tight spot, so playing requires some compromises), a nice rooftop with a good view, and a kitchen where half of the equipment is broken. The kitchen also doesn\\'t have a scheme for labelling ownership, which is weird. There goes the five star rating.\\\\nWe booked a private room, which came with an AC and an old mini fridge. The room was a little cramped, but we didn\\'t really mind.\\\\nThe reason we left early, however, was bed bugs. We confronted Cliff about that and he was as devastated as we were. He seemed honestly concerned, gave us our money for the next night back (since we checked out early) and even put something on top. Bed bugs can happen at the best hotels, so it would be unfair to put all the blame on Cliff, so the bed bugs don\\'t factor into my rating.\",\"My friends and I went to a room just in front of the kitchen.
