0,Fantastic location right on the waterfront. The private double room was spacious enough and had decent A/C. If you aren’t a party-goer then definitely avoid staying on a Friday night as the hostel hosts ‘Filthy Friday’…,4,2 months ago on Google
1,"I stayed one week in a private room as a solo traveler. Super convenient location, great amenities (workspace, restaurant/bar and services), and lots of options for social activities and visiting the island (great recommendations and flexibility from Jean Carlos who runs the tourism booth at the entrance!).
I had a great time and would definitely come again",5,3 months ago on Google
2,"Do not recommend, very rude staff. Bad service especially at the bar/restaurant. On top of that very loud music played every night until midnight (you literally cannot sleep even with earplugs).
The room is very small and dirty.
One positive note is the information desk about the different excursions (very helpful and very kind).",1,2 months ago on Google

5,"Amazing stay, the staff was extremely friendly all the time. Clean hotel, It’s a good option to chill while having drinks with a nice view right next to the ocean, What I liked the most was its location, easy to walk to different attractions like bars and places to eat.",5,3 weeks ago on Tripadvisor
6,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Bocas del Toro and are eager to return. Selina Backpackers provided a delightful stay with friendly and welcoming staff. It's the perfect place to unwind during the day and let loose in the evenings. However, I wouldn't suggest it for those seeking tranquility at night. I rate it 3 out of 5 stars, deducting points for the malfunctioning air conditioning and the broken steps for accessing the ocean, which made it difficult and potentially hazardous, especially after a few drinks. Despite these issues, it remains a beautiful spot that I would recommend to the younger crowd.",3,a month ago on Google

8,"This place is the worst hostel I have stayed in to date and I have been staying in hostels for months.  There’s almost too much to list…
LOUD music until sunrise every night (no sleep).
DIRTY facilities.
NO social atmosphere for solo travels. Lots of older couples.
They let anyone in that wants to come at any time. Once again, super loud always with no sleep.
NO lockers.
NO showers/toilets besides the one in your room.
NO chill area besides the bar/kitchen.
Everything is a hustle for Selina to make more money.
Rude Staff.
Broken toilets/hot water, etc.
Water cuts off daily and randomly.

Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your money on such a horrible place in such a nice place.",1,2 months ago on Google
9,The private room with ensuite at this Selina was really nice and comfortable and Luis at reception was super welcoming and accommodating so overall I had a great stay. It also seemed pretty social and had lots of activities. As with most Selinas though the general area incl the kitchen is quite run down. They also charge for things like using the phone booths in the coworking space which I find a bit ridiculous when you're already paying a premium to stay here.,4,2 months ago on Google
10,"Very unfriendly staff. We came from partying at 4 in the morning and wanted to brush our teeth, but there was no water at all.
Private bedroom very small, tiny bed (too small for 2 persons). No good value for money.",2,2 months ago on Google
11,"This was my first time staying at a Selina hotel. We stayed for 3 nights in a room where all the beds were infested with bed bugs. Every day we woke up with more bites, and we couldn't sleep because we kept waking up to scratch. This has never happened to me before.
The room key card demagnetized several times, and we had to go to reception to have it reactivated. Additionally, we were charged for towels to use for bathing.
The staff's service was not good.
The only positive aspect of this hostel is its proximity to the beach and the availability of taxis to different islands from there.",1,2 months ago on Google
12,"Located right on the water and close to all the shops/restaurants/bars. That said, this is more if a ""party"" hostel (at night), so if that isn't your vibe then this particular property probably isn't for you. During the day, it's super laid back though.",5,4 months ago on Google
13,"Had a great Stay, Thank you Vera for all your help checking in. And Nate for helping me check out. Last night was the best night ever.
The Band and Salsa was Awesome. Thanks Amy Vera",5,2 months ago on Google
14,"Fantastic stay so far! Great atmosphere, legitimately the best tacos I've ever had (the salsa, my  god), and the early Hatha yoga with Renzo was the perfect start to the day!   Bit of noise at night, but that's sorta the aim of party hostels, eh?",5,4 months ago on Google
15,"Absolutely awful place. Bocas is nasty generally but this was worst hostel I've ever stayed at. The only plus is for those who like to party and have a LOT of money, the bar is jumping loud most nights until very late. Drunks super expensive and the noise is unavoidable. People switch off the air con in the awful dorms.",1,a month ago on Tripadvisor
16,"This review is mainly about the tour adviser Jeancarlo, he was so helpful with making sure we knew exactly where to go and what to expect. Even when we didn’t book anything through him he would still help us so well. He was amazing!!!",4,4 months ago on Google
17,"We recommend it without any doubt.

* On the one hand its facilities are very well located in Bocas del Toro island of Colon, which has the most atmosphere of all the islands. Great variety of services offered: movie room, wellness centre, free yoga and meditation classes, slackline, walking tour the first day, other paid classes such as surfing, paddle, etc., bar, restaurant, main terrace super nice, spacious, and chill music open until 2am, upper terrace, coworking, kitchen with nice space  to eat (although the tools and appliances need a renovation), correct rooms and bathrooms , management of a variety of tours from the same hostel, management of transport to other parts of Panama, bike rental, surfboard rental, etc, etc, etc, etc.. Very complete.

* The best part is the atmosphere. 80% backpackers travelling 20-35 years old. Everyone willing to talk and make friends. If you don't know English you'll have a hard time because almost all of them are Europeans or americans, few Latin/Spanish.

*Recommendations: The hostel organises a welcome cocktail and a daily evening activity on the terrace (beer pong, salsa night, disco, life music, ...) very useful for socialising. Every Friday there is a well known day party called Filthy Friday that starts and ends in Selina, passing through two more stops on other islands (boat transport included). It's expensive but worth it, it's a complete Caribbean party. I would recommend staying 4 nights in Bocas to have a good stay and enjoy some tours.

Delighted with the experience at this hostel. Now I understand why is this one the best known in Bocas for a single traveller.
A pleasure.",5,2 months ago on Google

My favorite activity was the sunset photography walking tour with Juan! He showed me really dope spots around bocas town, even telling me the history of different murals and buildings. He took some really great pictures which he edited and sent to me pretty quickly. Great memories!",5,5 months ago on Google
20,"This review is about the shuttle to Boquete Selina booked for us.

It was an absolute catastrophe.
DO NOT BOOK shuttle with Selina.

They made us come to the hostel at 11:30.
After a 2 minute walk to he dock we had to wait until 12 for the boat.

Then when we got off the boat and waited for the shuttle for an hour!
We only started the drive at 13:30.

Then in the stop along the way, they told us 10 mins. But they hold us there for 30 mins more because apparently they wanted some of the shuttle passengers (not us) to pay more money! In the middle of the way, making other people wait.

Absolute disaster!!!
We wasted a full day and only got their 2 hours after the time they told us, and there was no traffic at all.",1,3 months ago on Google

Damp, mouldy cramped rooms. Nothing was ready for our visit and then a room change after complaint of mouldy mattress.

27,"First
If you don't surf i would highly recommend not to come to bocas del toro. Even if you surf, if you know a good spot, so go better to that one.
The people here are very unfriendly and you really feel how they look the tourists as living moneypocket.
Bocas town is ugly, it rains a lot and there is nothing to to there except visiting the islands. But keep in mind, it rains a lot, so even if you want to visit an island it will probably rain.

So i would highly recomend Colombia. It's a very beautiful country, with a lot of things to do there. It's much cheaper and the people there are opener and friendlier.

In selina there are two receptionists that are very unfriendly and incompetent. Even when you ask them for simple things like new towels or toilettpaper you will wait 1 hour until you get it. The shower didn't worked once and we asked the receptionist if there is a problem and if they could solve this. She told us, that she will call one who will repare the shower. But no one came. And many other things like that happend.",3,4 months ago on Google
28,"Really frigging weird to be cooking a meal in the guest kitchen and just have half a dozen members of the staff cooking for the hotel getting in the way and giving guests attitude. Why doesn't the staff have their own kitchen? It's already crowded enough having to sharing the space with other guests.
I was told my room was $22 a night but I was charged $29 a night instead for a top bunk that has barely 2.5 feet of room between the bed and the ceiling, and a big beam right over the ladder. It's really difficult to get in and out of the bed, and there's absolutely no bar to keep me from falling out at night and hitting the ground. Overall, I've stayed at much better for much less.

34,"Booked transport to San Jose via the Selina tour desk. Ending up being half of normal shuttle service to Puerto Viejo (boat to almirante, then private van to border) but then you are on public buses to San Jose.

I was through immigration etc with time enough so I could have at least got the 3pm direct bus but was sitting around waiting for their people and now more waiting and doing two separate buses. May even get stranded in Limon, if bus doesn't arrive in time. Utter joke, better to do proper shuttle service all way to Puerto Viejo and get public bus yourself than this ripoff scam.",1,5 months ago on Google

I really didn't like that they had us download an app to my phone to checkin ahead of time, this has since been deleted but not a good sign.   The room itself wasn't available when it was time to check in, this was the fault of the previous guest who came back several hours after checkout.

The manager here made it right and then some in my opinion and the rest of our stay went off without any more issues.
