1,We slept in a double bed room with A/C and our own fridge. For breakfast they offer ingredients (water and flour) and you can make your own pancakes. Unfortunately one day we went to a trip and at 8:30 there haven't been any ingredients before. It was not the cleanest hostel but still a good place to relax with rooftop and some couches. Sometimes there was nobody at the reception to answer questions and you have to search for them in the hostel. The location is quite good and central.,3,5 months ago on Google
2,"Cliffs is an extremely well priced hostel with a pool table, free breakfast (pancakes!) and a well equipped kitchen.

The staff are extremely friendly, especially Alexis who worked with us for over a week after we left to return a couple of items that we accidentally left behind.

Alexis was so warm in welcoming us and went waaaayyy above and beyond to return our forgotten items.

The rooms are simple and very clean have air conditioning so there’s nothing to complain about.  The showers have excellent water pressure and even have hot water!!

I would highly recommend staying at Cliffs, just to meet Alexis more than anything else.

Thanks so much again Alex!!!",5,4 months ago on Google

4,I really enjoyed staying in this hostel. The rooms are clean and you have everything you need.

6,"A very cool place. It is a small hostel with nice common areas where you get to meet people. The volunteers and employees were nice and helpful. The mattresses in the double room were a bit uncomfortable due to the plastic cover, the dorm beds are probably better. It offered a fun and cheap hiking tour through the jungle which I would highly recommend.",5,a year ago on Google
7,"The place was not particularly new, clean or welcoming. If you wanna pay with card there's an extra 10% charge, but the card machine 'happened' not to be working.
Like other reviews mention the pans are old and the kitchdn equipment is lacking. Best thing is you get free pancakes for breakfast.

8,"Editing this post to answer the owner:

Our room was nice, we had warm water and wifi. Unfortunately the staff (especially the receptionist) is not really friendly and you dont feel very welcome there. Since we came there we had to firm a visitors form in which stated as follows: ""before check in and after check out you are not my guest and its prohibited to use the facilities unless its accepted by the staff"" and also there is a camera in the kitchen and many paper with passive aggressive messages like ""wash your things, we see you, we know who you are..."" kinda strange.. And the ""included breakfast"" is a pancake mix put in the kitchen which everyone has to prepare for themselves

Answer: we did understand what was written on the house rules we had to sign at the entrance since you gave us these in english and spanish which i speak fluently. You dont have to speak these languages fluently to understand the sentence: ""before check in and after check out you are not my guest and its prohibited to use the facilities unless its accepted by the staff""",3,a year ago on Google

10,"I had a wonderful stay at Cliff's hostel. Cliff was very friendly and accessible and he made an effort to interact with and get to know his guests. The hostel itself is a great environment. Everyone I met there was nice and inviting. All the facilities (shared shower room and bathroom) were incredibly clean and well kept. There is ample space to socialize or hang out, including a huge TV in front of comfortable couches, a room with hammocks, a pool table on the second floor, and a rooftop lounge area with canvas covering. It is very accessible from the airport (only a four minute walk) as well as dozens of restaurants, shops, and tourism services like dive shops.",5,5 years ago on Google

13,The guy at check-in and check out was super nice and helpful but the older guy was quite strict and frankly rude. Not really the good vibes advertised. The whole place needs a good renovation.
